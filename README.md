# NFL Game Prediction Model

This project predicts NFL game outcomes using historical game data, betting spreads, and team performance metrics.

---

### 🧠 Methods Used
- Data Cleaning & Feature Selection (Pandas)
- Train/Test Split (scikit-learn)
- Logistic Regression Classification
- Model Performance Evaluation

---

### 📊 Model Accuracy
**~71.7% accuracy** predicting whether the home team wins.

---

### 🏈 Why This Matters
This project demonstrates real sports analytics skills:
- Working with large datasets (14,000+ games)
- Using Python for data analysis and modeling
- Applying machine learning to real-world sports problems
- Communicating insights clearly

---

### 🔥 Future Improvements
- Add advanced metrics (EPA, DVOA, QB rating, injuries)
- Compare models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Test accuracy *by season/week* to improve betting prediction quality
